# HAL

Implementation of the higher-order abstraction learning (HAL) model.

There is an informal description of the model at [astoundment.com/HAL.html](http://astoundment.com/HAL.html).

This code probably still won't make much sense until I add more comments. If you're brave, however, start with `src/symlearn/postsearch.clj`. The function `run-hal` is where the top-level iteration happens, and is designed to look as much like pseudo-code as possible.

## Usage

```
lein javac
lein run -m genlearn.postsearch/-main hal.config
```

*(TODO: Explain what the output means.)*
